This is a README for the first exercise in this section.

# 0. Follow the instruction in the README.md file in the "exercises" folder

Before following steps in this README, follow the steps in the `README.md` file in the `exercises` folder to set up your local Airflow.

# 1. Copy the DAG's starter code

Copy the starter code for the DAG to the `dags` folder you've created while setting up Airflow locally

# 2. Restart the scheduler

To restart a scheduler process open the terminal with the running scheduler process, and stop it using the `Ctrl+C`.

After this, start it again using the following command:

```sh
airflow scheduler
```

# 3. Implement the TODOs in the code

Now implement the TODO comments in the starter code.


# 4. Start the DAG

Once the DAG is implemented you can start it by clicking on the toggle in the Airflow UI for the DAG you've implemented.
